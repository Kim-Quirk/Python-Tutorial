# Python Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Data Structures Tutorial.  Every Python programmer should understand these basic Data Structure topics:

- [Stacks](1-stack.md)
- [Linked Lists](2-linked-list.md)
- [Trees](3-trees.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
